      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis. My research lies at
        the
        intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Economy. I examine how economic transformations, such as
        labor market shifts, the transition to renewable energy, regional
        inequality, and housing crises, shape politics in established democracies. My work leverages a range of
        research
        designs and data sources, including natural experiments, large-scale surveys and administrative data.</p>

      <p>Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at <a
          href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I graduaded with a PhD from the Department of
        Government at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> in
        2022. </p>

              Housing</a></b>
          (with Andreas Wiedemann). Conditionally Accepted, <i>American Journal of Political Science.</i>
          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('housing');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="housing" style="display:none;"><br>Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for
            affordable
            housing. In this paper, we propose that electoral constraints can undermine local politicians' incentives to
            build
            public housing. This occurs because voters' diverging preferences for spending conflict with municipalities'
            long-term goals to provide affordable housing. Empirically, we draw on the full-count census of all housing
            built in
            Germany, data on 19,671 local elections between 1989 and 2011, and an original survey. Using a
            difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that local incumbents experience moderate electoral losses
            after
            constructing new public housing. We then show that these losses are not driven by homeowner opposition or
            native-foreigner competition. Instead, we develop a novel argument that voters punish local incumbents for
            new
            municipal housing when they prefer spending on other prioritized policy domains. Our results have
            implications for
            the origins of the affordability crisis and suggest potential strategies to mitigate electoral constraints.

          (with Anselm Hager and Robert Vief). Conditionally Accepted, <i> Journal of Politics.</i>
          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('nimby');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="nimby" style="display:none;"><br>Affordable housing is a key challenge of the 21st century. A pivotal
            driver of growing housing prices is residents' opposition to construction, a phenomenon known as NIMBYism
            ("Not In My Backyard"). To make housing more affordable, city governments are increasingly implementing rent
            control policies. Does rent control---by making tenants more likely to stay in their apartments---spark
            NIMBYism and thus exacerbate the housing crisis? We study the case of Berlin, which recently passed a
            sweeping rent control law. Leveraging two discontinuities in the policy, we show that rent control made
            tenants less NIMBY. Specifically, tenants in rent controlled apartments became more likely to approve of
            local-level construction and immigration, compared to tenants in non-rent-controlled apartments. We argue
            that the decline in NIMBYism is likely due to an economic channel. Tenants in urban centers associate
            construction and immigration with displacement pressures and gentrification. Rent control alleviates these
            concerns by providing financial and residential security.

          <div id="newspaper2" style="display:none;"><br> How does the decline of local news affect political
            polarization? We
            provide novel panel evidence on this question in a multi-party setting. In particular, we shed light on the
            link between newspaper exits, media consumption, and ultimately electoral behavior. To study the aggregate
            relationship between local news exits and polarization, we rely on a unique panel of all German local
            newspapers between 1980 and
            2009. In addition, we precisely trace individual-level mechanisms by drawing on an annual media consumption
            survey
            of more than 670,000 respondents over three decades. Using a difference-in-differences design, we
            demonstrate that
            local newspaper exits increase electoral polarization, which aligns with evidence from the American context.
            Going
            beyond prior work, we then document that local news exits increase polarization because affected
            constituents
            substitute local news with national tabloid news. Finally, we show that local news exits increase
            politicization and
            partisanship at the individual level.

            “periphery”
            in the center-periphery conflicts of modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building
            literature
            that emphasizes the prevalence of a “wealth of tongues” (Weber 1976)—or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a
            region—as a definition of the periphery, we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a
            linguistic
            survey in Germany to show that voters from historically peripheral geographic communities are more likely to

            significantly eased labor market access for refugees in the majority of the country. Using administrative
            employment
            data, we show that the policy led to a substantial increase in refugee employment, while natives' wages and
            employment rates remained unaffected. The policy also had a positive effect on natives' attitudes toward
            migration.
            Voters exposed to more refugees in the labor market were two percentage points more likely to vote for
            pro-migration
            parties across both state and federal elections. Additional survey analyses suggest that our results are

          <div id="flood" style="display:none;"><br> A growing literature shows that extreme weather events induce
            pro-environment attitudes. We examine the political effects of a severe flood shortly before the 2021 German
            federal
            election. Drawing on about 600,000 survey responses and electoral data, we assess how flooding affected (i)
            the
            perceived salience of climate change, (ii) self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting
            in
            federal elections. We find that even severe local flooding had little to no effect on these outcomes.
            Additional
            evidence supports two mechanisms underlying this finding: nationwide rather than local effects of severe
            disasters,
            and voter demands for disaster relief rather than climate change prevention. We test the former mechanism
            using a

          <div id="census" style="display:none;"><br> Does government spending on public goods affect the vote choice of
            citizens? On the one hand, voters have been
            characterized as "fiscal conservatives" who may turn toward conservative parties when government spending
            goes up.
            Onthe other hand, increased spending may signal that the economy is doing well, which makes progressive
            parties a
            more viable option. To adjudicate between both hypotheses, this paper draws on a natural experiment, which
            created
            exogenous variation in government spending. A discontinuity in the 2011 German census meant that some
            municipalities
            saw an unforeseen increase in budgets. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that the increase in
            budgets
            and subsequent spending on public goods benefited left-leaning parties, but had no effect on incumbent
            support. To
            parse out the causal channel, we rely on panel evidence and demonstrate that treated residents viewed their
            economic
            situation more favorably, which led them to espouse progressive parties.

            While a growing body of research studies the initial spatial allocation of refugees, there is little causal
            evidence
            on subsequent policies that restrict residential mobility. We study a contentious law in Germany, which
            barred
            refugees from moving to a location different from the one they were randomly assigned to. To identify the
            causal
            effect of the movement restriction on integration, we utilize a sharp date cutoff that governs whether
            refugees are
            affected by the policy. We demonstrate that restricting freedom of movement had pronounced negative effects
            on
            refugees' sense of belonging in Germany while increasing identification with their home countries. In
            addition, the
            policy decreased engagement in a variety of social activities. Our findings suggest that discriminatory
            policies
            send a negative signal about the inclusiveness of the host society and thereby reduce the psychological
            integration

            revolutionaries believed unequal inheritances among siblings to be responsible for the strict hierarchies of
            the ancien regime. To achieve equality, the revolutionaries therefore enforced equal inheritance rights.
            Their goal was to empower women and to disenfranchise the noble class. But do equal inheritances succeed in
            leveling the societal playing field? We study Germany—a country with pronounced local-level variation in
            inheritance customs—and find that municipalities that historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day,
            elect more women into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic
            data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also
            show that, counterintuitively, equitable inheritance customs positively predict income inequality. We
            interpret this finding to mean that equitable inheritances level the playing field by rewarding talent, not
            status.</div>

          (with Matthew Blackwell, Adam Glynn and Connor Phillips). Revise & Resubmit, <i>Journal of the Royal

          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('did');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="did" style="display:none;"><br> Political scientists are increasingly interested in controlled direct
            effects, which are important quantities of interest for understanding why, how, and when causal effects will
            occur. Unfortunately, their identification has usually required strong and often unreasonable
            selection-on-observeables assumptions for the mediator. In this paper, we show how to identify and estimate
            controlled direct effects under a difference-in-differences design where we have measurements of the outcome
            and mediator before and after treatment assignment. This design allows us to weaken the identification
            assumptions to allow for linear, time-constant unmeasured confounding between the mediator and the outcome.
            Furthermore, we develop a semiparametrically efficient and multiply robust estimator for these quantities
            and apply our approach to a recent experiment evaluating the effectiveness of short conversations at
            reducing intergroup prejudice. An open-source software package implements the methodology with a variety of
            flexible, machine-learning algorithms to avoid bias from misspecification.

          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('placebased');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="placebased" style="display:none;"><br>Place-based economic policies are increasingly seen as
            instruments to counter political discontent in
            economically-depressed regions. Do regional investment subsidies affect electoral behavior? We evaluate this
            question in
            the context of Germany's largest regional investment program. Our identification strategy leverages a 2014
            subsidy rate
            cut for manufacturing firms that -- due to EU rules -- was exogenous to local economic trends. The subsidy
            cut reduced
            voting for the far-right AfD and increased support for the incumbent Christian Democrats. We then
            demonstrate that
            subsidy cuts trigger two counterreactions: local firms invest more in human capital and local governments
            invest more in
            infrastructure and public goods. We argue that these dynamics signal to voters that local governments are
            responsive and
            care about their constituents, undermining populist appeals. Our findings suggest that political
            consequences of
            place-based policies -- and austerity more broadly -- cannot be understood without considering
            counteractions by local
            firms and governments.</div>

          <div id="greentransition" style="display:none;"><br>Green transition policies set long-term targets to reduce
            carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a threat to
            workers in polluting occupations and communities reliant on these occupations. Can far right parties attract
            voters who
            anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious green policies
            and a large
            workforce in polluting occupations. The far right AfD started campaigning as the only party opposing green
            transition
            policies in 2016. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support increased in counties with
            more
            polluting jobs after this platform change. A panel survey further demonstrates that individuals in these
            occupations
            also shifted towards the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find suggestive evidence that growing far right support
            is due to
            changing perceptions of social stigma and lower status. Our results highlight the need for a new research
            agenda on a
            backlash against the normative dimension of the green transition.</div>

          <div id="gender" style="display:none;"><br> What accounts for differences in electoral success between male
            and female candidates? We argue that parties
            systematically nominate female candidates to districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for
            women to
            get elected. Our empirical strategy uses the German mixed electoral system to create counterfactual gender
            vote gaps.
            These gaps represent the scenario where male and female candidates are nominated in districts where their
            respective
            parties have equal popularity. Using data on all candidates for the German Bundestag across eleven
            elections, we
            document that female underperformance, and its variation across parties and election years, is explained
            almost entirely
            by women running in districts where their party is less popular. In contrast, we find no evidence that voter
            bias or
            candidate characteristics play a substantial role. Our argument highlights gendered party gatekeeping that
            increases in
            district strength as an important driver of female underrepresentation.

              in the GDR</a></b>
          (with Hans Lueders and Sascha Riaz)

          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('gdr');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="gdr" style="display:none;"><br> Citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently communicate grievances
            to the government. While there is some evidence that governments respond to such petitions, little is known
            about the nature of this responsiveness: can petitions yield tangible improvements to citizens' livelihoods?
            To answer this question, we assemble a novel panel of housing-related petitions to the government of the
            German Democratic Republic (GDR) and all housing constructed between 1945-1989. Exploiting the timing of the
            largest housing program in 1971, we employ a difference-in-differences design to show that construction was
            targeted at regions with higher rates of petitioning. We then use a variance decomposition method to
            benchmark the importance of petitions against objective indicators of housing need. Our results suggest that
            petitions allow citizens to meaningfully influence the allocation of public resources. The paper contributes
            to nascent scholarship on responsiveness in non-democratic regimes and shows that responsiveness leads to
            tangible improvements in citizens' livelihoods.

              Mortality</a></b>

          <i><a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('covid');">[Abstract]</a></i>
          <div id="covid" style="display:none;"><br> Do political and social features of states help explain the
            evolving distribution of reported Covid-19 deaths? We identify national-level political and social
            characteristics that past research suggests may help explain variation in a society's ability to respond to
            adverse shocks. We highlight four sets of arguments---focusing on (1) state capacity, (2) political
            institutions, (3) political priorities, and (4) social structures---and report on their evolving association
            with cumulative Covid-19 deaths. After accounting for a simple set of Lasso-chosen controls, we find that
            measures of government effectiveness, interpersonal and institutional trust, bureaucratic corruption and
            ethnic fragmentation are currently associated in theory-consistent directions. We do not, however, find
            associations between deaths and many other political and social variables that have received attention in
            public discussions, such as populist governments or women-led governments. Currently, the results suggest
            that state capacity is more important for explaining Covid-19 mortality than government accountability to
            citizens, with potential implications for how the disease progresses in high-income versus low-income
            countries. These patterns may change over time with the evolution of the pandemic, however.
