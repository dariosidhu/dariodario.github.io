# Key takeaways

**Employees in brown occupations**

-   Brown job workforce shrank from 10% in 1990 to under 5% by late 2010s.
-   Brown employees typically male, less educated, younger, but do not necessarily earn less.
-   Brown employees tend to support all parties less, except AfD.
-   Over 60% of sample, disproportionately brown employees, support no major party.
-   Brown employees show rising AfD support, declining Greens support, and a increasing trend of non-support.
-   Conditioning on background variables, especially immigration worries, greatly reduces partisan support differences between brown and non-brown employees.
-   Political effect of unemployment conditional on having been employment in Brown jobs: no clear patterns to me

**Energy transition prominence:**

-   Interest in the term "Energiewende" significantly increased from 2010, peaking around 2014. (Google Trends)
-   Google News searches followed this trend, beginning to rise in 2010 and reaching a peak in 2016.
-   Bundestag speeches saw a surge in "Energiewende" mentions from 2012 to 2014, after sparse mentions until 2011.
-   SPD and Greens made noticeably more mentions of "Energiewende" in 2013, potentially linked to campaign activities.

## Effect of unemployment on party support, conditional on having been employed in a brown occupation

The model regresses party support on a dummy for unemployed, and does this separately for people who used to be employed in a brown occupation, and those that were not employed in a brown occupation.

There are two diffferent definitions of having worked in a brown job -- (i) ever, or (ii) recently, where "recent" employment is defined as within the last 2 years. Covariates are age, sex, ISCED, income and worries about immigration.
