Hi! Iâ€™m Dario. I'm a PhD student in Political Science at UCLA.

Before starting my PhD, I worked in a number of roles at the intersection of social science and public policy. I served as the inaugural Director of Research for the [Penn Development Research Initiative - DevLab@Penn (PDRI)](https://pdri.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. Before that, I was an Advisor with the [Behavioural Insights Team's (BIT)](https://www.bi.team/) Canadian office in Toronto. I helped build BIT's Canadian practice in its first two years. Earlier, I was part of the Incubator team at [Evidence Action](https://www.evidenceaction.org/) in Washington, DC, an NGO that scales evidence-based development interventions to improve the lives of millions in low-income countries. I worked on sourcing, designing and prototyping development interventions backed by rigorous academic research. At some point before that, I was at the [Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE)](https://www.piie.com/), where I did research on international trade, competition, and firm dynamics.

I hold an MA from [Johns Hopkins SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/) and a BSc in economics from [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/).
