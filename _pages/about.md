Hi! I’m Dario- an international development professional working on using rigorous evidence to design better public policies: in short, turning social science into social good. 

I currently serve as the inaugural Director of Research for the [Penn Development Research Initiative (PDRI)](https://pdri.upenn.edu/) at UPenn, where I work on advancing PDRI's mission by developing collaborative research partnerships and leading the development of PDRI events, initiatives, and other outputs.

Previously, I was an Advisor with the [Behavioural Insights Team's (BIT)](https://www.bi.team/) Canadian office in Toronto. I helped build and grow BIT's Canadian practice in its first two years. Before that, I was part of the Beta Incubator team at [Evidence Action](https://www.evidenceaction.org/), an NGO that scales evidence-based development interventions to improve the lives of millions in low income countries. I worked on sourcing, designing and prototyping development interventions backed by rigorous academic research. At some point before that, I was at the [Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE)](https://www.piie.com/), where I did research on international trade, competition, and firm dynamics.

Apart from my own work, I’m invested in contributing to better public understanding and use of social science research, particularly on international development topics. To that end I have, among other efforts, served as an advisor to newspapers, start-ups and other outlets. If you would like to work with me, please send me an email at firstname.lastname@gmail.com. You can also get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dariosidhu).

I hold an MA from [Johns Hopkins SAIS](https://sais.jhu.edu/) and a BSc in economics from [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/). I am currently based in Philadelphia, and am a dual Austrian/Canadian national.
