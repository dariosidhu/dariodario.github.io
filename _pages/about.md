Hi! I’m Dario- an international development professional working on using rigorous evidence to design better public policies: in short, turning social science into social good. 

I currently serve as the inaugural Director of Research for the [Penn Development Research Initiative (PDRI)](https://pdri.upenn.edu/) at UPenn, where I work on advancing the initiative's research activities and lead the development of PDRI events and outputs.

Previously, I was an Advisor with the Behavioural Insights Team's (BIT) Canadian office in Toronto. I helped build and grow BIT's Canadian practice in its first two years. Before that, I was part of the Beta Incubator team at Evidence Action, a non-profit organization that scales evidence-based development programs that improve the lives of millions. I worked on sourcing, designing and prototyping development interventions backed by rigorous academic research. For a taste of their work, and to learn why I’m proud to have worked there, see some of the news coverage they have gotten. At some point before that, I worked at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), where I did research on international trade, competition, and firm dynamics.

Apart from my own work, I’m passionate about contributing to better public understanding of social science research, particularly on international development topics. To that end I have, among other efforts, served as an advisor to newspapers and other outlets. If you would like to work with me, please send me an email at firstname.lastname@gmail.com. I am also occasionally active on Twitter.

I hold an MA from Johns Hopkins SAIS and an undergraduate degree in economics from Vienna University of Economics and Business. I am currently based in Philadelphia, and am a dual Austrian/Canadian national.
